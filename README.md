# Covid-19 Cases and Rates in the US 

## Introduction
To better visualize the Covid-19 pandemic in the US, we use a choropleth map to show the Covid-19 rates and a proportional symbol map for the Covid-19 cases in each county during 2020. 

## [Map 1](https://olithinivia.github.io/covid-in-US/map1.html): Choropleth Map of the Covid-19 rates in the US

#### Primary Map Function
This map shows the rates of Covid-19 in each County during 2020. Hover the mouse cursor over the county to see more information about the Covid-19 rates. The information displays on the upper left window. 

## [Map 2](https://olithinivia.github.io/covid-in-US/map2.html): Proportional Symbol Map of the Covid-19 cases in the US

#### Primary Map Function
This map shows the cases of Covid-19 in each County during 2020. Click on the dots to see more information about the Covid-19 cases in different county. The information displays in a pop-up window.
